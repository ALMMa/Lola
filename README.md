# Lola

Lola Project is the ultimate CMS.

Based on a brand new architecture design, with escalability and resiliency in mind, Lola Project aims to (by thinking outside the box) deliver a completely new experience for developers, designers, content-managers and writers.

This is a placeholder for the Loja Project, which is in its very early conceptual phase.
